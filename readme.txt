Here is the research project that I have worked on during my internship at Laboratoire d'informatique formelle of UQAC, which took place between April and June 2022 and was mandatory in order to get my DUT Informatique in France (which is like Quebec Diploma of College Studies in computer science). 
Our goal is to predict, using machine learning, if a CVE will be exploited in the wild or not. 
When the internship ended, tasks were mainly model selection & tuning.

Don't forget to rename the "your_home" variable in consts.py, as it should be the path to the folder where you put the files in.

Some problems you might encounter
=====================================

If you encounter an encoding problem while trying to load the CSV feature matrix using Pandas, please read this.

"df_cves = pd.read_csv(consts.feature_matrix_url)"

When running this line, you might get a message like this :

"UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x94 in position 28389: invalid start byte"

Here is how I managed to fix this problem.

First, check encoding of the file :

import chardet
import consts
rawdata = open(consts.feature_matrix_url, 'rb').read()
result = chardet.detect(rawdata)
charenc = result['encoding']
print(charenc)

Windows-1252

In my case, it was encoded with Windows-1252. So I did the following :

1) Open the file in read mode, with Windows-1252 encoding (cp1252)
2) Store its content into a variable using lines method
3) Open it again but in write mode, with UTF-8 encoding
4) Overwrite it with the variable that contains its content
5) Close

import consts
with open(consts.feature_matrix_url, 'r', encoding='cp1252') as f1:
	lines = f1.read()
	f2 = open(consts.feature_matrix_url, 'w', encoding='utf-8')
	f2.write(lines)
	f2.close()

This worked fine for me.
